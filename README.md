This repository consists of intermediate code of Language Translation model used to convert Spoken Language to Sign Language Translations.
The subset of this project includes creating a sequence to sequence(nueral network) model capable of Language Translation(from source to target language) in 
this case from English to American Sign Language(ASL) Gloss. This code can be supplied with other data like matching ENG to French or ENg to Spanish corpus 
to enable Language Translation.

This model works on Tensorflow and Keras , its an precursor to Transformer its a sequence to sequence model utilising LSTM cells to build up context vector.
